Hello welcome to my reposotory, below are the things I did in order to create my JavaScript playground.

First, I went to github and created a new repository after successfully creating a repository I proceeded to copy the URL link and paste it on my visual studio app.

Second is that I followed the coding steps that our tutor showed us.

And lastly after coding everything I did the steps in order to finish my repository. Saved, Commited, and Pushed my codes into my github repository.
